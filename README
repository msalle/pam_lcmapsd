Description:  Provides a PAM module that can authenticate against an LCMAPSd
              service. It can use either a proxy, e.g. obtained via pam_myproxy
	      or using DN (in future also FQANs). In the latter case, it is
	      necessary that another module has authenticated the input DN, e.g
	      via pam_radius. In case of using a proxy, it can optionally chown
	      the proxyfile to target_uid:target_gid. It can also rename the
	      proxy such that it contains the uid, in that case the env variable
	      X509_USER_PROXY is updated to point to the new file.
	      Options can be given either on the pam commandline or in a config
              file which can be specified on the pam commandline.
              Valid options:
		config           - only on commandline: specifies path of config
		                   file
                capath           - as understood by openssl and curl
                cafile           - idem
                hostcert         - idem (corresponding to clientcert)
                hostkey          - idem
		lcmapsd_url      - LCMAPSd url, e.g.
		                   https://localhost:8443/lcmaps/mapping/ssl
                lcmapsd_timeout  - LCMAPSd timeout (default 1 sec)
                lcmapsd_mode     - basic or full (default)
                proxyfmt         - format for renaming, %d is replaced with
				   target_uid, XXXXXX as in mkstemp() (default
				   /tmp/x509up_u%d.XXXXXX)
                rename           - whether to rename (default 1, i.e. yes)
                chown            - whether to chown (default 1, i.e. yes)
		del_proxy_on_fail- remove proxy upon failure (default 0, i.e.
                                   no)
                proxy_as_cafile  - use proxy also as cafile, probably needed on
                                   RH 6 and alike (default 0, i.e. no)
                intern_env       - whether to use the pam environment to pass
				   data from pam_sm_authenticate to
				   pam_sm_setcred (default 1, i.e. yes)

Example:      E.g.
		auth  required   pam_lcmapsd.so capath=/etc/grid-security/certificates lcmapsd_timeout=2
		
Notes:        Currently the LCMAPSd does not yet have support for passing FQANs
              via the restful interface and hence the pam_lcmapsd does not yet
	      use the FQANs. Also the sgids are currently not yet parsed from
	      the json output.
